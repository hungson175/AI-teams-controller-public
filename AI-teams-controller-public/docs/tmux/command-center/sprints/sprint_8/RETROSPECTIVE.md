# Sprint 8 Retrospective

**Sprint Goal:** File Browser Enhancements + Directory Picker + Team Notification
**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** QA PASS (14/14) - PO Accepted

---

## What Went Well

1. **Clean QA Pass** - All 14 tests passed on first full run
2. **Feature Completeness** - All three features delivered:
   - Directory Picker (5/5 tests)
   - File Browser Add File/Folder (6/6 tests)
   - Team Notification Indicator (3/3 tests)
3. **Error Handling** - Path traversal attacks properly blocked (400 Bad Request)

---

## What Could Be Improved

1. **Minor UX Gap** - Add File/Folder dialog doesn't pre-fill current directory path
   - QA noted: "path NOT prefilled - minor"
   - Low priority but would improve UX

---

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Consider pre-filling path in Add File/Folder dialog | PO (backlog) | Pending |

## Process Notes
