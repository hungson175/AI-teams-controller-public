## P2 - Medium Priority (When Capacity Allows)

### Direct Tmux Pane Attachment (xterm.js Terminal Integration)
**Status:** TODO (Research Complete - Boss Request 2026-01-07)
**Size:** M (Medium - ~2 days effort)
**Priority:** P2 (Boss saved for future)

**Problem:**
Current system captures tmux pane text output and renders it in frontend. This is one-way (read-only) and has 500ms polling delay. Users cannot interact directly with panes.

**User Story:**
As a user,
I want each role tab (PO, SM, TL, FE, BE, QA) to be a REAL interactive terminal connected to that tmux pane,
So that I can type commands and interact directly with each role instead of just viewing captured text.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Each role tab renders xterm.js terminal
- [ ] WebSocket connection to backend PTY service
- [ ] User can type into any pane from browser
- [ ] Full terminal interactivity (colors, cursor, prompts)

**Priority:** P2 (Boss wants to save for when capacity allows)

### Voice Command Auto-On/Auto-Off with Context Switching
**Status:** TODO (Boss: rough idea, needs refinement)
**Priority:** P2 (Quality of life improvement, not critical)
**Size:** M (requires careful design)

**Pain Point (Boss 2026-01-03):**
When switching between tabs and projects, manually turning voice on/off is tiring. Auto-switching could cause commands to go to wrong team when context changes mid-speech.

**Possible Solutions:**
- Lock context when recording starts
- Dynamic context with visual indicator
- Voice command prefix for explicit routing

### File Browser: Panel Resizing Bug
**Status:** TODO (New - Boss Request 2026-01-04)
**Size:** S (Small - UI bug fix)
**Priority:** P2 (Quality of life, not blocking)

**Problem:**
File browser panels have weird resizing behavior. When opening file browser, left panel becomes very narrow. When dragging left panel border to the left (to make it smaller), it doesn't shrink - instead, the right panel expands by exactly the drag amount. This is counterintuitive and makes panel sizing difficult to control.

**As a** developer using file browser
**I want** panel resizing to work intuitively
**So that** I can adjust panel sizes to my preference without unexpected behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Left panel opens with reasonable default width (not very narrow)
- [ ] Dragging left panel border left makes left panel smaller (not bigger)
- [ ] Dragging left panel border right makes left panel larger
- [ ] Right panel adjusts correspondingly to maintain total width
- [ ] Panel sizes persist across sessions (optional)

### File Browser: Complete CRUD Operations
**Status:** Partial (Create ✅ Done, Read ✅ Done)
**Priority:** P2
**Size:** S each

**Remaining Operations:**

#### Delete File/Folder
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Right-click on file/folder shows "Delete" option in context menu
- [ ] Confirmation dialog before deletion
- [ ] File/folder deleted via backend API
- [ ] Tree refreshes after deletion
- [ ] Toast notification confirms deletion

#### Rename File/Folder
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Right-click on file/folder shows "Rename" option
- [ ] Inline edit or dialog for new name
- [ ] Backend API handles rename
- [ ] Tree refreshes after rename
- [ ] Error handling for invalid names

### Keyboard Shortcuts: Escape to Close Dialogs
**Status:** TODO
**Priority:** P2
**Size:** XS

**Problem:** No keyboard shortcut to dismiss dialogs/modals. Forces users to click.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Pressing Escape closes any open dialog/modal
- [ ] Works for all dialogs (file search, create file, directory picker, etc.)
- [ ] Focus returns to previous element after close

### Epic: iOS Version of AI Teams Controller
**Status:** TODO (Boss Request 2026-01-17)
**Priority:** P2 (Medium priority - future sprint)
**Size:** L (Large - new platform)

**Problem:** AI Teams Controller currently runs as web application only. Need native iOS version for mobile management of tmux teams.

**As a** mobile user
**I want** native iOS app for AI Teams Controller
**So that** I can manage tmux teams from my iPhone/iPad

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] iOS app with tmux team management UI
- [ ] View terminal output from all roles (PO, SM, TL, FE, BE, QA)
- [ ] Send messages to roles via voice or text
- [ ] Real-time updates of team status
- [ ] Works on iPhone and iPad

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (Boss Directive):**
- [ ] Create separate iOS app folder (e.g., `ios-app/`)
- [ ] Work EXCLUSIVELY within iOS folder - FORBIDDEN to touch backend or any other folders
- [ ] All iOS work items must be added to this iOS epic in backlog
- [ ] Complete isolation from existing web/backend codebase

**TL (Tech Lead) - MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
Before implementing ANY iOS feature, ALWAYS read the web version implementation first (`frontend/` codebase). Understand how it works on web before designing iOS equivalent.

**WHY NO BACKEND CHANGES (Boss Experience):**
"The current web version is working very stably. From my experience, if you touch the backend now, we'll be in deep shit right away."

iOS app must consume existing backend APIs as-is. No backend modifications allowed.

**Priority:** P2
