|------|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | **MECE + Hypothesis-Led Problem Solving** | McKinsey | Structured analysis & market sizing | Freely available |
| 2 | **Gartner Magic Quadrant** | Gartner | Competitive landscape analysis | Methodology published |
| 3 | **Net Promoter System (NPS)** | Bain | Customer research & loyalty | Comprehensive docs |

---

## Recommendation 1: McKinsey's MECE + Hypothesis-Led Problem Solving

### Why This Framework

This is the foundational methodology used by all top consulting firms (McKinsey, BCG, Bain). It's the "operating system" for structured market research and analysis.

### The Framework

**MECE Principle** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive):
1. **Mutually Exclusive**: Categories don't overlap - each item fits in only one bucket
2. **Collectively Exhaustive**: All possibilities covered - nothing is missed

**Hypothesis-Led Problem Solving Process:**

```
1. DEFINE THE PROBLEM
   └── Clearly scope what you're solving

2. STRUCTURE THE APPROACH (MECE)
   └── Break into non-overlapping, complete categories

3. DEVELOP HYPOTHESES
   └── Form testable assumptions about solutions

4. TEST HYPOTHESES
   └── Gather data to prove/disprove (80/20 rule - focus on 20% that gives 80% insight)

5. SYNTHESIZE FINDINGS
   └── Use Pyramid Principle (lead with conclusion, support with evidence)

6. COMMUNICATE RECOMMENDATIONS
   └── Executive-ready presentation
```

**Market Sizing Example (Bottom-Up):**
```
Market Size = Number of Customers × Units per Customer × Price per Unit

Steps:
1. Ask clarifying questions (revenue vs units? geography?)
2. Map calculations using MECE segments
3. Round numbers and calculate
4. Sense-check results
```

## Recommendation 2: Gartner Magic Quadrant Methodology

### Why This Framework

Best-in-class framework for **competitive landscape analysis**. Used globally to evaluate technology vendors, but the methodology applies to any market with multiple players.

### The Framework

**Two Evaluation Axes (15 weighted criteria total):**

| Axis | Criteria Count | Measures |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Ability to Execute** (Y-axis) | 7 | Financial viability, market responsiveness, product, sales, customer base |
| **Completeness of Vision** (X-axis) | 8 | Innovation, market understanding, future direction |

**Four Quadrants:**

```
                    ABILITY TO EXECUTE
                           ↑
         CHALLENGERS    │    LEADERS
         (Execute well, │    (Execute well,
          lack vision)  │     strong vision)
        ────────────────┼────────────────→ COMPLETENESS OF VISION
         NICHE PLAYERS  │    VISIONARIES
         (Small segment │    (Strong vision,
          or unfocused) │     weak execution)
```

**Data Collection Process:**
1. Technical RFI to vendors
2. Customer surveys (20+ per vendor)
3. Analyst team evaluation against weighted criteria
4. Internal peer review
5. Public sources (SEC filings, articles, social media)

**Bonus: Gartner Hype Cycle** - 5-phase model for technology adoption maturity:
1. Innovation Trigger → 2. Peak of Inflated Expectations → 3. Trough of Disillusionment → 4. Slope of Enlightenment → 5. Plateau of Productivity

## Recommendation 3: Bain's Net Promoter System (NPS)

### Why This Framework

The global standard for **customer research and loyalty measurement**. Created by Bain partner Fred Reichheld in 2003. Now used by 2/3 of Fortune 1000 companies.

### The Framework

**The Ultimate Question:**
> "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?" (0-10 scale)

**Customer Segmentation:**

| Score | Segment | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 9-10 | **Promoters** | Enthusiastic advocates, fuel growth |
| 7-8 | **Passives** | Satisfied but unenthusiastic, vulnerable to competition |
| 0-6 | **Detractors** | Unhappy customers, damage brand through negative word-of-mouth |

**NPS Calculation:**
```
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

Example:
- 50% Promoters, 30% Passives, 20% Detractors
- NPS = 50 - 20 = +30
```

**NPS Score Interpretation:**
- **70+**: World-class (Apple, USAA)
- **50-69**: Excellent
- **30-49**: Good
- **0-29**: Needs improvement
- **Negative**: Critical issues

**Key Insight:** Bain research shows NPS leaders grow at 2x the rate of competitors.
