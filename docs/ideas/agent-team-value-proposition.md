# Agent Team Value Proposition - Content Ideas

**Purpose**: Material for writing documentation explaining what our app does and why it's valuable

## 1. How Agent Teams Work & Why They're Good

**Core Concept**: Multi-agent coordination using tmux sessions
- Each agent = specialized role (PO, SM, TL, BE, FE, QA)
- Communication via tm-send tool
- Persistent sessions that survive crashes
- Battle-tested templates (Scrum team, research team, etc.)

**Why It's Good**:
- Separation of concerns (each agent focuses on one thing)
- Parallel work (multiple agents work simultaneously)
- Clear accountability (each agent reports back)
- Proven patterns (templates based on real team structures)

## 2. Self-Improvement: What It Means & Why It's Needed

**"Improve"**: Making the system better through updates/fixes

**"Self-Improve"**: The system learns from mistakes automatically and gets better over time WITHOUT human intervention

**Why It's Needed**:
- **Problem**: Coding agents keep forgetting bugs they've made in the past
- **Example**: Agent makes JWT bug Monday, fixes it. Makes SAME bug Friday because it forgot.
- **Solution**: Memory system stores "hard-won lessons" so agents never repeat mistakes
- **Result**: Agent gets smarter over time, learns from experience

**Key Insight**: Without memory, you're just renting an agent. With memory, you're training an agent.

## 3. Scrum Adaptation: Reality vs. Theory

**The Reality**:
- Pure "textbook scrum" rarely works in real teams
- Every team adapts scrum to their actual situation
- What works = what fits reality, not what fits definition
- Most "scrum" teams aren't true scrum by definition - and that's OK

**Applied to Agent Teams**:
- Agent team framework is inspired by scrum but adapts to AI constraints
- Execution-based (not time-based) because AI agents work 24/7
- Mandatory report-back protocol (because agents can't see each other's work)
- Active PO (demands updates) vs passive PO (watches progress)
- WORKS because it fits AI agent reality

## 4. Voice: The Underrated Feature of 2025

**Why Voice?**

**Misconception**: "Voice is just about solving typing"
**Reality**: "Voice is about solving thinking"

**How Voice Changes Work**:
- Typing forces you to think before you type
- Voice lets you think WHILE you speak
- Result: You work much faster
- You catch ideas in real-time instead of losing them during typing

**The Problem**:
- This is hard to understand until you actually use it
- People dismiss voice as "nice to have"
- Reality: Voice is a productivity multiplier

**2025 Context**:
- Voice is underrated despite being transformative
- Most people haven't tried it seriously enough to discover its value
- Once you experience "thinking at speaking speed", you can't go back

## 5. Memory: The Core Differentiator

**The Problem**: Coding agents have amnesia
- Make bug → Fix bug → Forget bug → Make same bug again
- No learning across sessions
- Every task starts from zero knowledge

**The Solution**: Vector-based memory system
- Stores episodic memories (what happened)
- Stores semantic memories (patterns learned)
- Automatic retrieval before complex tasks
- Automatic storage after task completion

**Why It Matters**:
- Turns disposable agents into improving agents
- Knowledge compounds over time
- Each mistake teaches the agent permanently
- Agent becomes YOUR agent, trained on YOUR codebase

## 6. Progressive Disclosure Philosophy

**Principle**: Show summary first, details on demand

**Why**:
- Context windows are precious (especially for AI agents)
- Long documents waste tokens that agents read every time
- Better: Short summary + link to details
- Reader chooses depth based on need

**Application Examples**:
- Backlog: If task >20 lines → Summary in backlog + link to detailed file
- Whiteboard: Current sprint only, past sprints in Git history
- Documentation: Overview → Deep dive (separate files)

**Result**: Clean, scannable documents that don't waste context

## Usage Notes

These ideas should be organized and refined when writing:
- Landing page / README
- Blog post explaining the project
- Demo video script
- Documentation introduction

Keep it practical, not theoretical. Focus on real problems solved, not abstract benefits.
