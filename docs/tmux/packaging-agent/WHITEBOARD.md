# WHITEBOARD - Packaging Agent Team

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
- Keep VERY clean - whiteboard is for ONE sprint only
- After sprint ends: Delete content, keep only template
- If content >10-20 lines: Move to separate file and reference it
- Git history manages past work, not whiteboard
- Context pollution kills AI agent effectiveness

## Last Sprint: P0 Claude Code Autonomous Installation Testing (COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Can Claude Code read our installation docs and autonomously install all 3 components? Document what Claude Code struggles with.

**Approach**: Fresh LXD container → Install Claude Code → Point at README → Let Claude Code autonomously install → Document friction

**Key Insight**: Installation guides are written FOR CLAUDE CODE to read, not manual steps for humans

## Active Work

| Role | Status | Current Task |
|------|--------|--------------|
| PO | STANDBY | P0 testing complete - awaiting Boss assignment |
| DEV | STANDBY | All critical fixes committed - container cleaned |
| DU | STANDBY | Test report complete - awaiting next assignment |

**Auth Resolved** (00:02): Environment variables approach worked (settings.json failed)

**Test Complete** (00:09):
- ✅ Duration: 4m 50s autonomous work
- ✅ 2/3 components installed (tmux + Web UI)
- ⚠️ 1/3 blocked (Memory - Docker permissions)
- ✅ 8 critical findings documented
- ✅ Claude Code validated installation docs work

**Test in Progress**:
- Repo: https://github.com/hungson175/AI-teams-controller-public
- Claude Code reading README and installing autonomously
- DEV monitoring and documenting issues

**Issues Found & Fixed**:
1. ✅ --dangerously-skip-permissions flag (646c566)
2. ✅ Root user restriction (953cf55)
3. ✅ Auth via env vars (60a228f)
4. ✅ Sudo requirement (2d0b9c4)
5. ✅ PATH troubleshooting (056bab5)
9. ✅ Frontend @codemirror/lang-yaml (a20e127) - P0
10. ✅ /init-role command installation (667ae45) - P0

**Remaining Issues** (documented in findings report):
6. 📋 Docker group permission
7. 📋 PEP 668 venv requirement
8. 📋 pyproject.toml flat-layout

**DEV Deliverables**: Technical execution log (6 phases), findings, error captures
**DU Deliverables**: Test report at docs/testing/INSTALLATION_TEST_REPORT.md

## Component Status

- Component 1 (tmux-team-creator): ✅ Ready for testing
- Component 2 (Memory System): ✅ Ready for testing
- Component 3 (Web UI): ✅ Ready for testing

## Critical Testing Patterns (from memory recall)

1. **Smoke test FIRST** before detailed testing
2. **Start services in dependency order**: Qdrant → Memory → Web UI
3. **Use bash TCP checks** for Qdrant healthcheck (no curl in minimal image)
4. **Verify deployment config** in container (env vars, API keys)
5. **Graceful shutdown** for Qdrant data integrity
