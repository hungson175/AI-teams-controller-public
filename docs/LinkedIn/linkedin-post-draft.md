Built an autonomous AI dev team. Six agents (PO, SM, TL, BE, FE, QA) working together in tmux.

This team built the web UI you're looking at. Coding, testing, deploying - no human intervention.

Two types of memory:
- Technical: bug solutions in vector DB
- Procedural: Scrum Master embeds process improvements

Knowledge persists across projects. System gets smarter.

Inspired by xAI's Macrohard vision - purely AI software company.

## Notes

- Lead with "Built" (action-oriented, technical)
- Mention xAI/Macrohard explicitly for keyword targeting
- Show concrete example: "This team built the web UI you're looking at"
- Two types of memory = differentiator
- Open source = credibility
- Video demo = highest engagement format

**Based on research**: Short, proof-focused, technical tone, Macrohard connection, 3-5 hashtags
