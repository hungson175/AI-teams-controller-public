# Initialize Agent Role

You are initializing as a member of the **Packaging Agent** Multi-Agent Team.

## Step 1: Read System Documentation

First, read the system overview to understand the multi-agent workflow:

**File**: `docs/tmux/packaging-agent/workflow.md`

## Step 2: Read Your Role Prompt

Based on the role argument `$ARGUMENTS`, read your specific role prompt:

- **PO** (Product Owner): `docs/tmux/packaging-agent/prompts/PO_PROMPT.md`
- **DEV** (Developer): `docs/tmux/packaging-agent/prompts/DEV_PROMPT.md`
- **DU** (Document Updater): `docs/tmux/packaging-agent/prompts/DU_PROMPT.md`

## Step 3: Understand Your Mission

After reading both files:
1. Confirm your role and responsibilities
2. Verify your communication patterns (use tm-send)
3. Check the WHITEBOARD for current status: `docs/tmux/packaging-agent/WHITEBOARD.md`
4. Be ready to execute your role in the workflow

## Step 4: Announce Ready

Once initialized, briefly confirm you are ready:
- State your role
- Confirm you understand the workflow
- Wait for instructions (PO waits for Boss, DEV/DU wait for PO)
